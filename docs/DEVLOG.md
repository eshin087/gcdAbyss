## 2026-11-01 — Session 1: from reference study to playable slice (v0.1.0)
**Goal:** a demo matching @Ansenjeo's ASCII MMORPG look (camera, art style) with a dragon in a forest.

**Done**
- Studied the reference (X banner + 4 clips): steep top-down perspective camera, three glyph
  techniques (arranged strokes, screen-grid ASCII, glyph FX), night palette, fire light spill.
  Findings in `docs/STYLE.md`.
- Built the rendering foundation + world myself; validated against the reference via screenshots.
- Parallel agent workflow built the dragon, player, HUD/flow and audio modules against
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, each independently reviewed, then an integration check (35 events wired,
  headless sims for win / death / retry / pause / breath).
- Playtest fixes: opening breath killed a standing player in ~2 s (tick 9→5, range 13→11.5,
  opening cooldowns); sword hitbox more forgiving (blade radius 0.05→0.22); phase-2 molten glow
  reduced to thin seams; shadow lookups use `textureLod`.

**Feedback from the owner (drives v0.2)**
- Loves the overall look; trees are the reference for "perfect ASCII feel".
- Wants: anime (SAO-like) characters; more detailed stone ASCII; creatures less "solid" / more
  ASCII; grass more ASCII; bigger dragon; much easier fight, no stamina (RPG/MMO not pure souls);
  block + parry + perfect dodge with Phantom-Blade-Zero-style tells; a Lab/debug mode;
  long-term repo + docs structure.

**Next:** v0.2 combat & presentation pass (see ROADMAP M1).
