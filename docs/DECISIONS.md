# Architecture Decision Records

Short records of significant decisions. Append new ones; don't rewrite history — supersede instead.
Template: **Context** (why decide) · **Decision** · **Consequences**.

## ADR-001 — Browser + Three.js, plain ES modules, no framework (2026-11-01)
- **Context:** fastest iteration on a custom rendering style; the reference (Ansenjeo) is also JS.
- **Decision:** Three.js (WebGL2) with hand-written ShaderMaterials; plain ES modules served as-is in
  dev (import map → `node_modules`); esbuild only to produce the single-file release.
- **Consequences:** no bundler config to maintain; zero-install play via `dist/index.html`; we own
  all shaders (no three.js lighting/shadow chunks), so shared GLSL lives in `render/shaderLib.js`.

## ADR-002 — Hybrid ASCII rendering (2026-11-01)
- **Context:** the reference uses three glyph techniques: arranged stroke glyphs (grass, dragon
  skin), screen-grid ASCII (rocks, canopies) and glyph FX.
- **Decision:** materials write an alpha FLAG into an HDR scene target; a post pass converts flagged
  pixels to a pixel-exact character grid (stone / leaf ramps); creatures use surface-space glyph
  cells; FX are glyph particles composited after the grid pass with a soft depth test.
- **Consequences:** every visible thing must pick one of these paths (see STYLE.md). New looks are
  added as new ramps/flags or glyph layouts, not as conventional shading.

## ADR-003 — Module contracts + event bus (2026-11-01)
- **Context:** modules were built in parallel by several agents and must keep scaling.
- **Decision:** a shared `game` context object, explicit per-module contracts and an event catalogue
  in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; HUD/audio/flow react to events instead of being called directly.
- **Consequences:** adding a feature = emit/subscribe catalogued events; contract changes must update
  the doc and all consumers in one commit.

## ADR-004 — Headless integration tests with real modules (2026-11-01)
- **Context:** agents often cannot watch the game; logic regressions must be caught without WebGL.
- **Decision:** `tests/integration` runs the real Player/Dragon/Hud/Flow/Audio with a mocked DOM,
  WebAudio and world, driven by a bot through scripted scenarios; `tests/glyphcheck.mjs` statically
  validates glyph literals.
- **Consequences:** `npm test` must stay green on `main`; new systems add scenarios.

## ADR-005 — Hosting: GitHub (public) + Vercel static deploy (2026-11-01)
- **Decision:** public repo `eshin087/gcdAbyss`; Vercel project `gcdabyss` builds `npm run build`
  and serves `dist/` at gcdabyss.vercel.app; every push to `main` deploys, PRs get previews.
- **Consequences:** `main` must always be shippable; CI runs tests + build on every push/PR.

## ADR-006 — Protected main, PR-only changes, lean deployments (2026-11-01)
- **Context:** the owner wants every change reviewed through a PR and auto-deployed, and Vercel
  deployment storage across the owner's projects had grown far past the quota from stale deployments.
- **Decision:** GitHub branch protection on `main`: PR required (0 approvals, enforced for admins),
  required check `test-and-build` with up-to-date branches, linear history, no force-push/deletion;
  squash/rebase merges only, branches auto-delete. Vercel: Git integration only (no CLI deploys),
  30-day retention for every deployment state, and an `ignoreCommand` that skips docs/tests-only
  commits.
- **Consequences:** releases happen by merging PRs; production is always the latest merged `main`;
  previews exist per PR and expire automatically.
